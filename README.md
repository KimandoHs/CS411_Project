Brief Summary: Repository for the CS411 Group Project, fall of 2022. Lab Section A3. 

Ideas:
- SpaceAPIs
- Chess? 
- Weather API that tells you what clothes you can buy nearby for that weather
- Car emission calculator based on your model of car and the distance you travel
- Sentiment API to see if your mood matches up with your style of writing
- ASTROLOGY
- Plants. User will submit photo or photos for plant identification. Use one API to identify the plant species, and use another
API to retrieve facts about that plant. We can also consider using a weather or climate API to figure out its suitability for
cultivation in a particular climate zone.
- Incorporate sentiment API, joke API, and activity API. After a user input a text (a few words that comes to mind), 
we perform a sentiment analysis that return positive, negative, or neutral (or perhaps more specific and varied).
Then we output jokes of corresponding types and suggested activities related to the sentiment of the user. 
We can also track the change of sentiment of users through a week.
- Design a personalized carbon emission tracker. Enter different carbon-emitting factors of daily life
and weigh how much users contribute to the overall carbon-emission every day or in total. Users can also see what
travel options are best wehn considering carbon emission parameters. They may also view the world-wide carbon-emissions in real time.
