CS411 Team Assignment 1 - Proposal

Idea 1: An App regarding plants 
Users will submit photo or photos for plant identification. We can use one API to identify the plant species, and use another API to retrieve facts about that plant. When a user submits a photo for identification, plants will be displayed on screen alongside a percentage of how closely they match. Users can then look through them to see if any exact matches came up. We can also consider using a weather or climate API to figure out its suitability for cultivation in a particular climate zone.

Idea 2: Personalized Carbon Emision Tracker
Our goal here is to design a personalized carbon emission tracker. Using this app, you can enter different carbon-emitting factors of daily life and see how much users contribute to the overall carbon-emission every day or in total. Users can also see what travel options are best when considering carbon emission parameters. They may also view the world-wide carbon-emissions in real time. They may also be able to see carbon-emissions under certain filters, such as carbon-emissions from certain countries or demographics.
