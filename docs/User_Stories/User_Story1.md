As a passenger on the street, when I see a plant that interests me but I donâ€™t know what it is, I want to take a photo of it and log in to upload the picture to get the information about the plant. I can get parameters such as the Latin name, category, climate area, and etc. about the plant. For convenience, the user can first shoot multiple plants of interest and upload all the pictures altogether to get the respective information about those plants if successfully identified. If the photo uploaded is too blurred to be recognized, the subject in the photo is not necessarily a plant, or our database simply do not have the plant in record, the system will return an error message saying that plant is not found.
