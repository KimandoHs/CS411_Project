As a person who simply wants to learn about plants, I can log in to my account and have flashcards and quizzes about all kinds of plants.
There should be a library of plants filtered by if we have or have not seen them, as well as other aspects of the plant (Climate, place of origin, etc.). 
When the user puts their mouse over a plant a stat-sheet of sorts should appear as well as a short description and fun facts about the plant. 
There is also a news feature where the user can keep up with the most recent discoveries in the plant world. 
When the plant library can not be loaded there should be an error message displayed and access to other aspects of the site should be maintained.
