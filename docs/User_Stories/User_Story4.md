As a person who simply wants to learn about plants, I can log in to my account and take a quiz about all kinds of plants. As someone who either wants to improve my knowledge or just have fun, I want to be able to see my score while taking the quiz so I can improve in the future. As a user, I think it would be cool if pictures I take can added to the database, and therefore the quiz section as well. That way, the community can see the pictures I take of cool plants.
