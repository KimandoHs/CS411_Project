As a user who has previously done searching using this app, I want to be able to create and log into an account. For ease, I want to be able to sign in using google or facebook. While logged in, I want to be able to favorite plants that I am interested in. I want to be able to store my favorited plants all in one place so I can revisit them and read information about them. I want to be able to show friends or family plants I have looked at. I want to be able to filter my favorited plants by factors such as climate, use, and more.
