As a person who is interested in buying and growing a house plant, I want to browse plants that suit me and my environment the best. I want to see pictures of the plants while browsing so I can find one I like. I want to be able to see the temperature ranges and conditions the plant needs to survive. I want to see what climate the plant is able to grow in so I know whether I can buy one in my state. I possibly want to know watering tips to help me take care of it.
