As a person who is interested in buying and growing a house plant, I want to browse plants that suit me and my environment the best. I want to see pictures of the plants while browsing. I want to be able to see the temperature ranges and conditions the plant needs to survive. I want to be able to see what ways the plant can be displayed or used. I want the option to choose from various drop-down menus that filter the plants by parameters such as climate, use, etc. beforehand.
