I am a passenger who travels a lot and enjoys exploring nature. As a passenger who has contacted an unknown plant and has adverse feelings or reactions, I want to check if it is the plant that I contacted that causes such effect. I would like to have a way to visually identify these plants that might have caused me discomfort, and I would like to quickly figure out and filter these plants. In particular, I want to know if the plant is poisonous or contains any allergens. By taking a picture of these plants, I can learn their names and do further research. These plants can then be marked for future reference.
