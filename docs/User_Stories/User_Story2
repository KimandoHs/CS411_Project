As a user who has previously done searching using this app, I want to be able to create and log into an account. I want to be able to view my “plantbase history” which holds all plants I have encountered and uploaded a photo of. I want to be able to view my favorited plants to revisit them. I want to be able to show friends or family plants I have looked at. I want to be able to filter my favorited plants by factors such as climate, use, and more.
